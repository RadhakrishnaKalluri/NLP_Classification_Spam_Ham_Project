# NLP_Classification_Spam_Ham_Project


**Project Overview**

This project involves creating a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (non-spam). The dataset consists of labeled messages that we will use to train a machine learning model for this classification task.




**Dataset**

The dataset used in this project includes SMS messages categorized into two classes:

ham: Regular messages

spam: Unwanted promotional or fraudulent messages


**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the process of building an NLP model to classify SMS messages as spam or ham. We preprocess the data, vectorize the text, develop and evaluate a machine learning model, and validate its performance using cross-validation and ROC-AUC scores.

**Requirements**

Python 3.x

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn
